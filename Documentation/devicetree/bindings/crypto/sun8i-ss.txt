* Allwinner Security System found on A80/A83T SoC

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be one of
	"allwinner,sun8i-a83t-crypto"
	"allwinner,sun9i-a0-crypto"
- reg: Should contain the SS register location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the device. (Non secure IRQ if
  both secure/non-secure exist)
- clocks : List of clock specifiers, corresponding to AHB and SS.
- clock-names : Name of the functional clock, should be
	* "ahb" : AHB gating clock
	* "mod" : SS controller clock

Optional properties:
 - resets : phandle + reset specifier pair
 - reset-names : must contain "ahb"

Examples:
	crypto: crypto@1c15000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-h3-crypto";
		reg = <0x01c15000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 94 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		resets = <&ccu RST_BUS_CE>;
		reset-names = "ahb";
		clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_CE>, <&ccu CLK_CE>;
		clock-names = "ahb", "mod";
	};
