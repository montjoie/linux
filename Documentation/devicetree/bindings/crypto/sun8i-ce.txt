* Allwinner Crypto Engine found on H3/A64/H5/H6/R40 SoC

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be one of
	"allwinner,sun8i-h3-crypto"
	"allwinner,sun8i-r40-crypto"
	"allwinner,sun50i-a64-crypto"
	"allwinner,sun50i-h5-crypto"
	"allwinner,sun50i-h6-crypto"
- reg: Should contain the CE register location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the device. (Non secure IRQ if
  both secure/non-secure exist)
- clocks : List of clock specifiers, corresponding to AHB and CE.
- clock-names : Name of the functional clock, should be
	* "ahb" : AHB gating clock
	* "mod" : CE controller clock

Additional required properties for allwinner,sun50i-h6-crypto:
- clocks : List of MBUS clock specifiers
- clock-names : Name of the functional clock, should be
	* "mbus" : MBUS gating clock

Optional properties:
 - resets : phandle + reset specifier pair
 - reset-names : must contain "ahb"
